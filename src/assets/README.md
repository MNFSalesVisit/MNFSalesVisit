Place your home-screen icon files here.

The app expects two PNG files:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192)  — used for Android/iOS home screen & manifest
- `icon-512.png` (512x512)  — used for higher-resolution devices

You provided a logo image via the conversation attachments. Please copy that image into this folder with the above filenames (you can resize it to 192x192 and 512x512). Once the PNG files are present, browsers will use them when users Add to Home Screen.
